URGENT TO DO:
-- Remove/update depricated functions (in develop!!)
-- Introduced error in calculating distFunction in clusterMany -- need to check the distance needed for a particular row, not all (right now have any(doDiss|doDissPost))
-- Need to update the indices of coClustering if add/subtract any clusterings! Create a test. (have done removeClusterings; addClusterings didn't need anything. still need to create a test...)
-- look at seqCluster and see if parameters make sense. In particular, top.can takes top 5 candidates, but maybe better to take top that are at least x% of data. Would splinter less.

MINOR TO DO:
-- RSEC has no @example! (add one with no run)
-- Make makeMissingDiss dependent on the dimension (i.e. TRUE for smallish matrices)
-- Make the default to be `removeDup=FALSE`. 
-- If run=FALSE in clusterMany, does it still do the transformation/filter/reduceMethod stuff (it shouldn't!)?
-- clusterSingle -- have intersection between type of data and dimensionality reduction! need to go back to this for what it means for type="cat". 
-- Add some kind of bare check 
    * that diss are at least symmetric dimensions!
    * inputs are actually matrices? (e.g. in subsamplingCluster)
-- check in seqCluster status of verbose versus checking arguments.

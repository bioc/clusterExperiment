TO DO:
-- Need mainClustering to take input 'cat' for categorical
-- Need to have types be 'X','diss','cat', and no both. Instead need to be able to take vector of types of input. This changes structure in the clusterFunction class
-- Need to have output of subsampling be NxB matrix, and downstream deal with that.
-- Fix .checkXDissInput
-- clusterSingle -- have intersection between type of data and dimensionality reduction! need to go back to this for what it means for type="cat". 
-- For clusterSingle and seqCluter  the check of inputs done by .checkSubsampleClusterDArgs, the outputted input match needs to be a single value, not all possible matches. Need to go back to both of these functions once decide what will do with .checkSubsampleClsuterDArgs as output.Need to fix the postProcessArgs
-- .makeDataArgs has a handle for data "either", need to go back to.
-- Should all 'diss' version take 'cat' with internal conversion into 'diss', or make user clarify that?
-- .checkCFInput makes stops, but .checkSubsampleClusterDArgs wants characters...should make try?

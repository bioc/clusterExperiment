TO DO:
-- Need to have output of subsampling be NxB matrix, and downstream deal with that.
-- clusterSingle -- have intersection between type of data and dimensionality reduction! need to go back to this for what it means for type="cat". 
-- Should all 'diss' version take 'cat' with internal conversion into 'diss', or make user clarify that?
-- Need to check the whole question of 1-diss of the percentages shared clustering (and what is stored in co-clustering matrix slot...)

-- post-processing needs diss matrix; by not passing both, have disabled ability to do the post-processing unless have clustering function that takes diss. The main reason might calculate the dissimilarity in clusterSingle? Might allow it there and then have a post-processing argument that is the diss...
-- Add some kind of bare check that diss are at least symmetric dimensions!
-- check in seqCluster status of verbose versus checking arguments. 

-- type "cat" problem in load built in because needs C code that is not recognized.

TO DO:
-- clusterSingle -- have intersection between type of data and dimensionality reduction! need to go back to this for what it means for type="cat". 
-- Should all 'diss' version take 'cat' with internal conversion into 'diss', or make user clarify that? USER

-- post-processing needs diss matrix; by not passing both, have disabled ability to do the post-processing unless have clustering function that takes diss. The main reason might calculate the dissimilarity in clusterSingle? Might allow it there and then have a post-processing argument that is the diss...
-- Add some kind of bare check that diss are at least symmetric dimensions!
-- check in seqCluster status of verbose versus checking arguments. 

-- figure out what to do for the coClustering slot.
-- Major error in clusterMany in the combination of distFunction and dim reduction -- doesn't get combination. Not fixing it yet, because want to be able to reproduce results before make fix. 
-- Also in makeConsensus, should remove -1 first and then do the clustering so not affect the results of the others.

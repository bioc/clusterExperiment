URGENT TO DO:
-- Remove/update depricated functions (in develop!!)

MINOR TO DO:
-- RSEC has no @example! (add one with no run)
-- Make the default to be `removeDup=FALSE`. 
-- clusterSingle -- have intersection between type of data and dimensionality reduction! need to go back to this for what it means for type="cat". 
-- Add some kind of bare check 
    * that diss are at least symmetric dimensions!
    * inputs are actually matrices? (e.g. in subsamplingCluster)
-- check in seqCluster status of verbose versus checking arguments. 
-- updateObject doesn't actually do anything for coClustering.

-- If run=FALSE in clusterMany, does it still do the transformation/filter/reduceMethod stuff? (it shouldn't! but a lot of work to change it, so going to leave it)

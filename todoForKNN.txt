TO DO:
-- figure out what to do for the coClustering slot.
-- Major error in clusterMany in the combination of distFunction and dim reduction -- doesn't get combination. Not fixing it yet, because want to be able to reproduce results before make fix. 
-- clusterSingle -- have intersection between type of data and dimensionality reduction! need to go back to this for what it means for type="cat". 
-- Add some kind of bare check that diss are at least symmetric dimensions!
-- check in seqCluster status of verbose versus checking arguments. 
-- Take off names have added to the labels from clusterMany (distAlgType, etc.)
-- If run=FALSE in clusterMany, does it still do the transformation/filter/reduceMethod stuff?
-- RSEC has no @example!

TO DO:
-- Need to have output of subsampling be NxB matrix, and downstream deal with that.
-- clusterSingle -- have intersection between type of data and dimensionality reduction! need to go back to this for what it means for type="cat". 
-- Should all 'diss' version take 'cat' with internal conversion into 'diss', or make user clarify that?
-- Need to check the whole question of 1-diss of the percentages shared clustering (and what is stored in co-clustering matrix slot...)

URGENT TO DO:
-- Remove/update depricated functions (in develop!!)

MINOR TO DO:
-- RSEC has no @example! (add one with no run)
-- Make makeMissingDiss dependent on the dimension (i.e. TRUE for smallish matrices)
-- Make the default to be `removeDup=FALSE`. 
-- If run=FALSE in clusterMany, does it still do the transformation/filter/reduceMethod stuff (it shouldn't!)?
-- clusterSingle -- have intersection between type of data and dimensionality reduction! need to go back to this for what it means for type="cat". 
-- Add some kind of bare check 
    * that diss are at least symmetric dimensions!
    * inputs are actually matrices? (e.g. in subsamplingCluster)
-- check in seqCluster status of verbose versus checking arguments.

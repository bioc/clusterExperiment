TO DO:
-- figure out what to do for the coClustering slot.
-- Major error in clusterMany in the combination of distFunction and dim reduction -- doesn't get combination. Not fixing it yet, because want to be able to reproduce results before make fix. 
-- post-processing needs diss matrix; by not passing both, have disabled ability to do the post-processing unless have clustering function that takes diss. The main reason might calculate the dissimilarity in clusterSingle? Might allow it there and then have a post-processing argument that is the diss... but means that if do it in clusterMany, will recalculate the diss every time -- no way to pass X for clustering and diss for the post-processing (e.g. doing it for kmeans). Right now clusterSingle kills on all attempts to do it if inputMatrix isn't dissimilarity. 
-- clusterSingle -- have intersection between type of data and dimensionality reduction! need to go back to this for what it means for type="cat". 
-- Add some kind of bare check that diss are at least symmetric dimensions!
-- check in seqCluster status of verbose versus checking arguments.
